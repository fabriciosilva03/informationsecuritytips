**Privilege Escalation**

privilege escalation is such a large topic that it would be impossible to do it proper justice in this type of room. However, it is a necessary topic that must be covered, so rather than making a task with questions, I shall provide you all with some resources.

General:

https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings (A bunch of tools and payloads for every stage of pentesting)

Linux:

https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/ (a bit old but still worth looking at)

https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum (One of the most popular priv esc scripts)

https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/blob/master/lse.sh (Another popular script)

https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester (A Script that's dedicated to searching for kernel exploits)

https://gtfobins.github.io (I can not overstate the usefulness of this for priv esc, if a common binary has special permissions, you can use this site to see how to get root perms with it.)

Windows:

https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html  (Dictates some very useful commands and methods to enumerate the host and gain intel)

https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerUp (A bit old but still an incredibly useful script)

https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS (A general enumeration script)
